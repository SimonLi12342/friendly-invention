# X-Team 67 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We can make schedules about the process of the whole tasks and distribute them evenly.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We can keep other team members updated when we complete a task. If a member needs help with their task then they should message the team in the group chat to collaborate on the task that a member needs help with.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
